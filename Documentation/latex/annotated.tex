\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera}{OpencvSfM::Camera} (We will need this class, but \hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_point_of_view}{PointOfView} need our class too.. )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera_pinhole}{OpencvSfM::CameraPinhole} (This class represent the physical device which take the pictures. It is not related to a 3D position which is the role of the \hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_point_of_view}{PointOfView} class. The role of the class is to store only intra parameters (without radial distortion) )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera_pinhole}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera_pinhole_distor}{OpencvSfM::CameraPinholeDistor} (This class represent the physical device which take the pictures. It is not related to a 3D position which is the role of the \hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_point_of_view}{PointOfView} class. The role of the class is to store intra parameters and radial distortion )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_camera_pinhole_distor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_motion_estimator}{OpencvSfM::MotionEstimator} }{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_motion_estimator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_motion_processor}{OpencvSfM::MotionProcessor} (This class try to create a commun interface for files loading. Indeed, if you want to use webcam, avi file of list of files, you will have to do some annoying processing, like iterate the different files of the directory. With \hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_motion_processor}{MotionProcessor}, you can now use a folder of image the same way you use a webcam or a video file )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_motion_processor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_point_of_view}{OpencvSfM::PointOfView} (This class represent the 3D position of the device which take the pictures. The role of the class is to store everything related to the filed of view: picture, 3D position, points, matches and 3D points )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_point_of_view}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points3_d_estim}{OpencvSfM::Points3DEstim} }{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points3_d_estim}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_matcher}{OpencvSfM::PointsMatcher} (A class used for matching descriptors that can be described as vectors in a finite-\/dimensional space )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_matcher}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_to_track}{OpencvSfM::PointsToTrack} (This class can be used to store informations about points and features. This is an abstract class: you can't use it directly. Use for instance \hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_to_track_with_image}{PointsToTrackWithImage} )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_to_track}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_to_track_with_image}{OpencvSfM::PointsToTrackWithImage} (This class can be used to find points and features in pictures using SIFT detector )}{\pageref{class_opencv_sf_m_1_1_points_to_track_with_image}}{}
